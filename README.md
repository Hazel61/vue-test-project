# test-project

## Project setup
For this project, my goal was to install a Vue app from scratch, using Vue-Cli, the command line, and Webstorm.

I had already installed npm and node on my computer, actually two versions of Node, so I deleted the old one. I
installed the newest version of Vue-Cli, version 3, with the command "npm install -g @vue/cli". To create a new project I
used the command "vue create test-project", and chose to use babel and eslint (the default configuration).
After my project was created I ran "npm run serve" to create a local server to test my app. I then made changes to the
HelloWorld.vue file and created both the aliases.config.js and vue.config.js files needed for my build and deploy to
GitHub. To process and build the package I ran "npm run build". I then successfully created a new repository in Github
and pushed my code to it within terminal. Within Github I had to tell Github to display my page from the files in the
docs folder.
